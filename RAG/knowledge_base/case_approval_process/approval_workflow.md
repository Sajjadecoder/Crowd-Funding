# Case Approval Workflow

## Overview
All campaigns submitted to our platform undergo a rigorous verification process to ensure legitimacy, protect donors, and maintain trust in our platform.

## Approval Process Timeline
- **Submission**: Campaign submitted by creator
- **Initial Review**: 24-48 hours
- **Verification**: 2-5 business days (if additional documentation needed)
- **Final Approval/Rejection**: 1-2 business days after verification complete
- **Total Time**: 3-7 business days on average

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Campaign Submission
Campaign creator submits all required information and documentation through the platform.

### Step 2: Automated Checks
System performs automated verification:
- Duplicate detection
- Fraud pattern analysis
- Document format validation
- Completeness check

### Step 3: Admin Assignment
Campaign automatically assigned to available admin from the verification team.

### Step 4: Manual Review
Admin team member reviews:
- Campaign story and details
- Uploaded documentation
- Creator's identity verification
- Bank account verification
- Background checks if necessary

### Step 5: Verification Process
Admin may:
- Request additional documentation
- Contact campaign creator for clarification
- Verify documents with issuing authorities
- Conduct reference checks
- Assess the genuineness of the cause

### Step 6: Admin Decision
Multiple admins may review complex cases. Decision outcomes:
- **Approved**: Campaign goes live
- **Needs Revision**: Creator asked to update information
- **Rejected**: Campaign declined with reason provided
- **Escalated**: Referred to senior admin for review

### Step 7: Notification
Campaign creator notified via email and dashboard about the decision.

### Step 8: Appeals Process
If rejected, creator can appeal with additional evidence within 14 days.

## Multi-Admin Review
For sensitive or high-value campaigns (>PKR 1,000,000), multiple admins must approve:
- Primary admin reviews and recommends
- Secondary admin verifies independently
- Both must approve for campaign to go live
- Senior admin resolves any conflicts

## Post-Approval Monitoring
Even after approval, campaigns are monitored for:
- Unusual donation patterns
- Fund misuse reports
- Creator misconduct
- Goal modifications
